# JamBot
First discord bot. Like other music bots but for friends or bandmembers to share their own music. 

# Install
To download the code you can check it out with the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/scott-robbins/JamBot
cd JamBot
```
# Setup your own bot 
Visit discord.developers.com/applications and set up your own instance of a bot. Take the Token 
from the tab under "Bot", after you have setup General Information. Also, to add the bot to your
server, visit the OAuth2 tab and after checking boxes for permissions you can create a link to 
connect your own server. 

# How to use it 
Once you have an instance of JamBot running in your server, you give it music in a DM via an attachment.

Then after you've joined a voice channel, which the bot has permission to be in, use the ```$play``` command to have the bot connect to the voice channel and start playing the song you specified.

# Disclaimer 
*The whole point of this bot is to play user provided files, as other bots are designed for playing music from links. It's generally unsafe to accept content from users, so not only should you scan all attachments, but probably not expose this bot on a public server.*
** If you choose to use this bot on your server consider yourself warned. I won't be liable for any negative consequences.**
